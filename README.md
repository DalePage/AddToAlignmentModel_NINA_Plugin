# Add To Alignment Model for CPWI Alt-Az Mounts
This plug-in can be used to create an alignment model for users of CPWI controlled Alt-Az mounts.

The user can select the number of points in both Azimuth and Altitude. Once triggered the mount is moved to the selected
cordinates and an image obtained and plate solved with the actual RA/Dec then fed back to CPWI as an alignment location.

The plugin has been developed and tested using CPWI with a Celestron Astro-Fi 6 mount and scope. It is beleived it will 
work with other CPWI controlled Alt Azimuth mounts but it cannot be guranteed.
